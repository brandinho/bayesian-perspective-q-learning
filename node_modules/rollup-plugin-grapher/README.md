# rollup-plugin-grapher

[Rollup](http://www.rollupjs.org) plugin to create an interactive module graph (powered by [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3))

## Installation

```bash
yarn add --dev rollup-plugin-grapher
```
or
```bash
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-grapher
```


## Usage

As with any other Rollup plugin, just add it to the `plugins` option in your RollupJS config.

```js
// In rollup.config.js
import rollupGrapher from 'rollup-plugin-grapher'

export default {
	entry: 'src/index.js',
	dest: 'dist/my-lib.js',
	plugins: [
		rollupGrapher()
	]
};
```

That will create a file named `rollup-grapher.html` when you generate the RollupJS bundle.
If you want to change the name or location of this file, specify a `dest` option to the plugin.

This plugin can also output all the module dependencies in the console by specifying
a boolean `verbose` option.

e.g.:

```js
// In rollup.config.js
import rollupGrapher from 'rollup-plugin-grapher'

export default {
	entry: 'src/index.js',
	dest: 'dist/my-lib.js',
	plugins: [
		rollupGrapher({
			dest: 'artifacts/module-dependency-graph.html',
			verbose: true
		})
	]
};
```
